In the table Directs and Writes nConst is an array
so we were not able to properly create a primary key.
Also because nConst is an array, the relationship nConst in People was unclear
so we made it one to one when it should be one to many.
In the table Character there was an error with the primary key.
We also simplified our tables compared to the staging ones
so we couldn't replicate some sql commands due to the arrays.
