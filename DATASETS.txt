Our dataset is from IMDb and contains information about movie titles, actors, directors, and much more.
The data files we are using are titled name.basics, title.basics, title.crew, title.principals, and title.ratings.
There are nconst and tconst which are alphanumeric unique identifiers for the person and title of the work.
All of the files have tconst.
For example, if you wanted to find an actor for a movie, they are connected between the name.basics file and t.basics file.
Because all of these files have tconst, we can analyze the relationship between all the files based on the title of a work.
The dataset and additional files can be accessed via this link. https://datasets.imdbws.com/
We hope to find interesting connections between people within the data, like how actors are connected with directors or writers.
Another intersting relationship to investigate is between actors and critically aclaimed movies.
