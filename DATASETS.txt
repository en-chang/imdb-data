Our dataset is from IMDb and contains information about movie titles, actors, directors, and much more.
The data files we are using are titled name.basics, title.basics, title.crew, title.principals, and title.ratings.
There are nconst and tconst which are alphanumeric unique identifiers for the person and title of the work.
All of the files have tconst.
For example, if you wanted to find an actor for a movie, they are connected between the name.basics file and t.basics file.
Because all of these files have tconst, we can analyze the relationship between all the files based on the title of a work.
The dataset and additional files can be accessed via this link. https://datasets.imdbws.com/
We hope to find interesting connections between people within the data, like how actors are connected with directors or writers.
Another intersting relationship to investigate is between actors and critically aclaimed movies.
We converted the tsvs to csvs via python.

Secondary Dataset:

Our secondary dataset is the Bollywood movies Dataset from kaggle.com, which contains details about Bollywood movies since 1920.
The dataset has three tables. The main table is Bollywood.csv, which contains information about each title, such as release data, cast, 
genre, and how much money it grossed in its best year. There are just over 9,600 titles in this table.

There are two complementary datatables; Bollywood-actors.csv, and Bollywood-actresses.csv. These datasets contain actor names and 
heights for roughly 275 actors and actresses in Bollywood, and the actresses table contains the role that these actors debuted in.

Some information that we would hope to gain from exploratory data analysis of these tables, as well as data set integration with our 
imdb data set is the average heights of some of the more prominent actors in Bollywood, the frequency of releases of movies by month,
the rating of Bollywood movies in the imdb database, and the relation between rating in the imdb ratings table and "crores" grossed by
the movie
