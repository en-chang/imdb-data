1. There are 6,182 films that have the same title and year in the Bollywood dataset, however, there are 0 of the same directors in the 
two tables. This points to there being some inconsistent naming conventions for directors between the two dataset. There is a good 
chance that for if a film from bollywood has the same title and year as a film in the imdb data set, the records are refering to the 
same film. So, our first query will be a series of joins between the two tables.

First, bollywoodDirects and bollywoodTitles will be inner joined on title to create table 1. Then, Directs_Beam_DF and title_Beam_DF
will be joined on tConst to create table 2. Finally, table 1 and table 2 will be joined on title. Then, the name of the director in 
the bollywood dataset can be compared with the name of the director in the imdb dataset to determine how to correct the differing 
naming conventions.

2. Again looking at the overlapping films in the two tables, a query will be run to compare the listed genre for a film in the
Bollywood dataset, versus the listed genre for that film in the imdb dataset. However, while the genre field in the imdb data is scaler
in the Bollywood, genre is a list of genres. So, prior to this query, the genre table in Bollywood will be transformed to be scaler.

3. A query will be done to look at the overlapping fils rating in the imdb table, and to look at the relation between rating, 
crores grossed, and date. However, there are three different columns in bollywood containing the date: one for month, one for day, and 
one for year. Before the date can be fully analyzed, these dates will have to be transformed into one date-time stamp.
